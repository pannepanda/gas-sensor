# gas-sensor
Everything you need to build a DIY gas sensor for volatile organic compounds 

This repository contains files that allow you to build your own sensor that can detect volatile organic compounds. The parts can be bought e.g. on eBay and cost all together around 30GBP. 

The repository contains an Arduino (.ino) file that is used to control the sensors. You can simply assemble the parts on a bread board or print your own PCB (eagle files and Gerber files included). 

Parts that you will need to buy (with an example of where to find it, you can buy any equivalent product as well): 

 - Controlling: Arduino Nano V3.0 ATmega328P1 (www.ebay.co.uk/itm/301449586123) 
 – MQ2 for LPGs/combustibles (www.ebay.co.uk/itm/350841296743)
 – MQ9 for CO/combustibles (www.ebay.co.uk/itm/321092341836)
 - Data indication: Liquid crystal display (www.ebay.co.uk/itm/131285312052)

Parts that you can buy to improve your device: 

 - Data logging: microSD storage board (www.ebay.co.uk/itm/281524711546)
 - Independent power supply: 9V block battery OR 
 - Independent power supply: Adafruit PowerBoost 500 (www.ebay.co.uk/itm/161448202346) with LiPo (www.adafruit.com/products/258) 

Short instructions on how to connect the parts can be found as comments in the Arduino file.
